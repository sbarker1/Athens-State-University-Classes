To show how far along I am in my studies, below are the following courses I have taken along with project descriptions that match my Athens State Classes GitHub Repository folders: 

Computer Science I – Critical thinking projects involving C++ programming
o Projects entailed using arrays, sorting/searching algorithms, logic control constructs, and parameter-passing mechanisms to construct theater seating and critical-thinking card games
• Data Structures – Develop linked lists and stacks/queues
o This project consisted of using given input to develop, modify, and manipulate a linked list. The project also contained numeric data where specific searches needed to be executed throughout a stack and queue.
• Wide Area Networks – Observe and test simulated systems of LANs
o Project covered the scope of network communication

Currently, I am taking these Computer Science/IT courses this semester:
- Intro to Assembly Language
- Analysis of Algorithms
- Fundamentals of Information Security
