//Directions:
//Add functions to your adj. list and adj. matrix that implements the depth-first and breath-first traverals algorithms for those graph representations. 
// The two member functions need to be passed the starting node for the traveral as an argument:
//void dfs(N startNode);
//void bfs(N startNode);

//Please Refer to AdjMatrixGraph.h & AdjListGraph.h files for answers wihtin this folder.
